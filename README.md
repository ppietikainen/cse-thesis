## cse-thesis

This LaTeX -template is for BSc and MSc theses of the CSE, BME and BA degree
programmes at the ITEE faculty of the University of Oulu.

It has been used by various people since the late 1990's, and has
slowly improved over time. It  still somewhat rough at the edges,
but hopefully will be helpful in reducing some of the pain involved in
writing a diploma thesis.

The current version of the template produces PDF/A-1b compliant PDF file,
which can directly be uploaded to Laturi (Muuntaja is NOT required).
This requires that transparency is removed from all images in your thesis.
Instructions for doing this are included in [[images.md]].

We kindly ask for students using this template to improve this template,
and share the improvements, so that others may benefit.

This template is distributed to students via Overleaf, and
https://github.com/ouspg/cse-thesis is synchronized with it. Issues
and pull requests can be made to GitHub.

### FILES AND FOLDERS
 * Chapters
   * This folder holds all the chapters that are added to the main file. To create more chapters simply create a .tex file in the chapters folder and input it in the main.tex file.
 * Figures
   * Place the necessary figures in your thesis here. A path to the figures has already been set when using "\begin{figure}...". Look for an example of how to use figures from Figure 1 and 2.
 * Gallery
   * This contains examples LaTeX snippets for doing various things that some theses might require. 
 * citations.bib
   * This holds all the bibtex citations. Use a reference manager like Zotero and use the "bibtex" form of citation when exporting from it. 
 * dithesis.sty
   * This is a package holds most of the style.
 * dithesis.cls
   * Similar to dithesis.sty, holds scripts and style.
 * main.tex
   * The main file. Input your information and files here.
 * ieee.bbx v1.4e 2025-03-14
   * This is needed to make @online citations comply with the IEEE style. TexLive 2025 should ship this, so can be removed once Overleaf has it
 * doclicense-csetemplate.sty, doclicense-images, doclicense-finnish.ldf
   * PDF/A-compatible CC license logos and .sty-file that looks for them in separate directory
     * Generated with gs -dPDFA -dBATCH -dNOPAUSE -sColorConversionStrategy=UseDeviceIndependentColor -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dPDFACompatibilityPolicy=2 -sOutputFile="$@" "$@.in.pdf"
   * Finnish translations to doclicense
 * images.md
   * Instructions on removing transparency from your images
 * README.md
   * This file!

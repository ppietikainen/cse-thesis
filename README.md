## CSE/BME/BA thesis

This LaTeX template is for BSc and MSc theses of the CSE, BME and BA degree
programmes at the ITEE faculty of the University of Oulu.

It has been used by various people since the late 1990's, and has slowly improved over time.

The template produces a **PDF/A-4f** and **PDF/UA-2** compliant PDF file, which can be uploaded directly to the successor of Laturi.

Transparency in images is supported and does not need to be removed.

We kindly ask students using this template to improve it and share the
improvements so that others may benefit.

This template is distributed to students via Overleaf, and
https://github.com/ouspg/cse-thesis is synchronized with it. 
Issues and pull requests can be made to GitHub.

### LoC
 * 2026-06-24 Pekka Pietikäinen
   * PDF/A-4f + PDF/UA-2 output via pdfmanagement/tagpdf, replacing pdfx
     * \DocumentMetadata enables full tagged PDF (tagging=on, mathml-SE)
     * Metadata (title, author, abstract, keywords, copyright) written via
       \hypersetup; .xmpdata file approach removed
     * LuaLaTeX supported (lualatex on devel branch, pdflatex on main)
     * Abstract can now include multiple paragraphs and math metadata + body text, the code automatically makes it work for both
   * Alt text for figures via alt= key in \includegraphics (PDF/UA-2 req.)
     * Alt text now documented in the accessibility section
   * Transparency in images is now allowed (PDF/A-4f/2b support it)
     * Removed pre-processed doclicense-images/ directory
     * Removed transparency removal instructions
   * algorithm2e: suspend/resume tagging to avoid UA-2 structure errors
   * Decimal comma math hack removed (broke \vdots and similar)
   * CI: verapdf updated to v1.30.2, validates PDF/A-4f and PDF/UA-2

 * 2026-06-02 Pekka Pietikäinen
    * Clarify that Finnish abstract is also required for international students (This changed a while back but was not changed in the instructions)

 * 2026-04-01 Pekka Pietikäinen
   * Update Turnitin link for 2026 (and note it changes annually)
   * Use citestyle=numeric-comp -> The official IEEE [1], [16], [17], [18]
     -> [1, 16-18]. If you need page numbers for one citation (or want the
     official IEEE style), use ~\cite{ref1},~\cite[p. 55]{ref2},~\cite{ref3}

 * 2026-01-15 Pekka Pietikäinen
   * Add Gallery/aiusage.tex with Finnish/English examples for one author
     no AI used

     translates properly (Fixes #21)
   * Clarify that your employer can also have image copyright

 * 2025-08-19 Pekka Pietikäinen
   * Changes to the instructions:
     * "Tiivistelmä" is now required for all theses. In a thesis written
       in English, abstract precedes "tiivistelmä" and vice versa.
     * Unification with changes done to 2025 ECE thesis instructions:
       * List of abbreviations and symbols: Greek letter italicisation rules
       * Tables must be in text format – not an image
       * Margins are now 2.5/2.5/2.5/3.0 cm (online)
       * Equation guidelines updated to match ECE
       * Font was Latin Modern in the text, but the template always used Times
       * Figure copyright location (was in footnote, now copyright page or caption)
       * References now IEEE style; Finnish translation is "Lähteet" (was "Viiteet")
     * Copyright and citation style
       * Copyright page added to thesis
       * Instructions for proper attribution for reuse/modification of images

A Master’s thesis in engineering usually consists of an implementation part (literature survey, hardware development, software development, measurements, etc.), and a written part (the text body). How the implementation part is carried out depends on the topic, so no general guidelines can be issued. However, each type of publication has its distinct layout and structure to be followed. The following set of instructions will explain in detail the writing and layout style for the master’s theses published in the engineering degree programmes at the Faculty of ITEE. Typography affects the readability of the text greatly, so the instructions should be followed strictly. By following these instructions, the thesis authors can properly learn a proper way of expressing themselves formally in writing. After having learned one way of formal writing, it is easier to get used to the formalism used at your future workplace. Presentation and layout style have an effect on the grade of the thesis.

Before starting to write your thesis, it is a good idea to mind-map or chart out the various issues that will be included in a thesis. After that, you should divide them into themes, actual chapters with actual title, and estimated numbers of pages to be included in each chapter. The contents should be discussed in detail with your principal supervisor. Pay attention on the weighting and focus of different topics. You should reserve enough time for writing your thesis, so that its content and structure will be as good as possible. It should be remembered that the archived thesis book is usually the only document through which your whole thesis work will later be assessed.

\section{Linguistic style}
\label{sec:linguistic_style}

As a general rule, students who have completed their matriculation exam in Finland write their Master’s thesis in Finnish or Swedish. Foreign students who are not fluent in Finnish write their thesis in English. The thesis can be also written in English if it is well-justified, for example, when the supervisor or the project team does not understand Finnish well enough. 

The language of a thesis written in English has to be flawless. If the thesis does not meet this requirement, or the principal supervisor feels that she/he is not capable of checking the language well enough, the supervisor can demand the thesis to be checked by a proofreading company, a person qualified to edit technological vocabulary in English, a native English speaker, or a person holding the degree of M.A. in English Philology. One should notice that the correctness of the language affect the grading of the thesis.

The thesis should have an abstract and a title in both English and Finnish. The only exceptions are the international master’s degree students who do not need to have the Finnish abstract or title. If the language of the thesis is English, the abstract in English comes before the abstract (tiivistelmä) in Finnish.

A Master’s thesis is written for an engineering audience. The author should therefore avoid presenting issues and topics that go beyond this scope. You should apply professional terminology when available. This rule also applies to all figures and tables.

The aim is a clear and well-structured thesis, \textbf{without unnecessary excessive use of words}---a thesis usually has 50-80 pages. The language (English/Finnish/ Swedish) should be fluent and readable, and it should adhere to the conventions and recommendations applied in a particular language. Advice on such issues can be obtained from various language guides (in Finnish, e.g., \cite{maamies}). There are also several excellent sources on the internet, e.g., \cite{korpela, kielitoimisto} in Finnish and \cite{reportwriting, englishlanguage} in English.

\section{Typography}

In the text typography, you need to use the following guidelines and rules:
\newlength{\mylen}
\setbox1=\hbox{$\bullet$}\setbox2=\hbox{\tiny$\bullet$}
\setlength{\mylen}{\dimexpr0.7\ht1-0.5\ht2}
\renewcommand\labelitemi{\raisebox{\mylen}{\tiny$\bullet$}}
\renewcommand\labelitemii{\raisebox{\mylen}{\tiny$\bullet$}}

\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{0pt}
    \setlength\parskip{0pt}
    \item Font: Latin Modern
    \item Page margin settings:
    \begin{itemize}[wide=0pt]
        \setlength\itemsep{0pt}
        \setlength\parskip{0pt}
        \item Left margin: 4,5 cm
        \item Right margin: 2,0 cm
        \item Top margin: 2,5 cm
        \item Bottom margin: 3,0 cm
    \end{itemize}
    \item Spacing:
    \begin{itemize}[wide=0pt]
        \setlength\itemsep{0pt}
        \setlength\parskip{0pt}
        \item Before a heading: 2 empty rows
        \item After a heading: 1 empty row
        \item Between two headings: 1 empty row
    \end{itemize}

    \item Line spacing: the default value for each font size, which is usually the font size +
    2 pts.
    \item A single row should be left between chapters. The 1\textsuperscript{st} paragraph after a heading should not be indented. Subsequent paragraphs should be indented by 0.5 cm.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Figures and tables}
The thesis should include figures and tables to support the text. They should be placed in the following manner as is automatically done when following the model of this \LaTeX template:

\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{0pt}
    \setlength\parskip{0pt}
    \item A single empty row should be left between text and the figure or table caption. 
    \item Table structure and the different fonts used in different instances are explained in
    \tabref{tab:sample_table}.
    \item In tables, the heading has to be placed above the table. The table heading should
    not end in a full stop. The permission to publish a table copied form another
    source has to be mentioned as part of the table heading. Many publishers inform
    the correct form to write this permission when such a permission has been
    granted.
    \item The figure caption text is positioned underneath the table and the caption text ends
    in a full stop. There should be no references in a caption text. The permission to
    publish a figure copied form another source has to be mentioned as part of the
    figure text. Many publishers inform the correct form to write this permission
    when such a permission has been granted.
    \item Do not start a chapter with a figure, but embed it in the text content. A figure is
    supposed to always appear in the text after its reference. If there is not enough
    space for the figure directly after the first reference, the word processor moves the
    figure automatically to the next page. In such case, the figure can be moved 
    forward so that text originally after the figure fills the empty space. However, a
    figure should always be placed in the same chapter---hence sometimes empty
    space at the bottom of some chapters cannot be avoided (the same rules applies for the
    tables).
\end{itemize}

You should not use single subsections---for example, Section 2.1 needs to be accompanied by Section 2.2. Also, please do not number sections beyond the 3\textsuperscript{rd}  grade (e.g., 1.2.1.1 should not be used). Should the need arise for further decimalization the following method below (a \textbf{bolded}, unnumbered heading that does not appear in the table of contents) should be applied:

\subsubsection{Formatting the figure captions} Figures, tables and appendices are a part of the written presentation. All these need to be referenced to in the text body, preferably before the figure is placed in the text---i.e., first the referring text, then the figure or table. Figures and tables have a running number through the document---or chapter wise, if there are plenty of figures.

\figref{fig:work_packages} serves as an example of a figure and a text referring to it. Figure captions are below the figure, and the caption text ends with a full stop. A short caption is centered, while a long caption extending to a several lines is justified on both sides. According to the copyright enactments, you must always have the permission from the copyright holder to use the figure in your work. \textbf{Copyright infringement may lead to legal actions and penalties, and in those cases the author is responsible.} The writer should grow towards to mainly using figures of his own in the thesis. \textbf{ \figref{fig:work_packages} serves as an example of authors' own production, thus requiring no reference or footnotes.} In other words: if no outside source is referred to, it is assumed that the author of the thesis is also the author of the figure.

As mentioned, in case the figure has been taken from elsewhere, the author needs to have a permission from the copyright holder. Usually this is based on a licence that gives permission to use the work with some conditions. The most common example would be a CC-BY licence, such as the one used in \figref{fig:ccbypic}. Note how the footnote is used instead of a citation to point to the original source.

\subsection{Algorithms}
Algorithms can be implemented simply using \LaTeX. An example of an algorithm is given in Algorithm \ref{alg:examplealg}. An input and an output for the algorithm should be assigned at the start. Equations or discussed methods can be referenced in the algorithm. Depending on one's needs the algorithm may be implemented in a higher level of pseudocode compared to one in Algorithm \ref{alg:examplealg}.

\section{Clarifying contributions and Using AI}
\label{AI}
Since a thesis is an independent work, it is important to clarify how much of the work was done by the author, how much by potential collaborators, and how much was Artificial Intelligence used in the process, if applicable. 

Generative AI is useful for various tasks, and its use is expected to increase. Therefore, we are generally positive about exploring the use of AI. However, the responsible and ethical use of AI is critically important. Always discuss AI use with your supervisor prior to writing the thesis, and familiarise yourself with the university's AI policies (https://www.oulu.fi/en/students/general-information-about-studying-at-the-university/guidelines-on-the-use-of-ai-in-education).

As a general rule, do not generate parts of your thesis; presenting content not produced by you as your own is considered fraud (in most cases, plagiarism) and is a serious ethical violation subject to appropriate consequences. You alone are responsible for the accuracy, correctness, and originality of your thesis and its parts. AI cannot be cited as a source of scientific facts and should not be used as a reference. With your supervisor's approval, AI can be used to assist in tasks such as brainstorming, planning, aiding information retrieval, creating or editing visuals (or other modalities), and language proofreading. Any other use cases also require approval from your supervisor. In all cases, it is your responsibility to ensure that the tools you use (including their licenses, terms, and conditions) permit the output to be utilized in your thesis as intended.

The thesis must include a disclaimer at the end of the introduction in a subsection titled "\textit{Author's Contributions and the Role of Artificial Intelligence}." This subsection serves two purposes. First, you should clarify your own contributions to the thesis, which is necessary in cases when the thesis is completed, for example, in a project with multiple contributors. Second, the section must detail the specific AI tools that were used, the purposes for which they were used, and in which parts of the thesis. For example: \textit{The author of this thesis designed the artifact, conducted all the research, and prepared the thesis. In preparing the thesis, ChatGPT (GPT-4) was used to correct grammar in all chapters. Additionally, Claude 3.5 Sonnet was used to help implement the evaluated artifacts and to describe the code functionality in Chapter 3.}




\section{Practical advice}

On average, it takes between two to three months of full-time work to write a Master’s thesis---around one finalized page per day. You might be able to write a thesis in a shorter time, but you should understand that \textbf{it takes much longer than you think to edit and re-edit a thesis, considering both structure and presentation style.} In the following we have listed some practical advice, which serves the purpose of making it easier to start the writing phase.

\subsection{Do not leave the writing to the end}

Working on the implementation and written thesis in parallel will force the author to clarify and reformulate ideas, which might often lead to new ideas and save time on editing, re-editing and restructuring later. At the least, you should start gathering and getting acquainted with your literature and charting out your written part into clearly defined units and chapters at an early stage. Once you have done this and you know where you are going, you will have a much more secure feeling of the scope of your thesis.

\subsection{Discuss in detail with your supervisor before you start writing and design a
body for your thesis}

It is in the best interest of the supervisor that the student graduates as fast as possible and is left without wider difficulties. She/he therefore has an excellent motive to give help in time. A typical problem at the beginning stage that can be fixed easily is a content structure, in which theory and practice have been clearly divided into two separate parts. If left unfixed, this may often lead to repetition and problems in combining the parts.

Hence, start your writing by planning a content structure, (table of contents), which will function as your backbone all throughout your work. Usually it is a good idea to construct your chapters so that you first give each heading and subheading a working name even if you do not have a final idea of the exact title at this stage. Each structural unit (heading) should have a few code words that act as the key to each heading. You can also look at it this way: code words convey a message to the reader, a message you as the author want to tell them. Later when you have started doing the actual writing, you should look at these code words and crystallize the message in each section to correspond to these code words. Thinking ahead like this will reduce the pain of creation, give you confidence and help you feel that your thesis is solid.

\subsection{Write things in the right order}

Most people find it convenient to write their thesis in the order of their table of contents. It is usually a good idea to start by writing the introduction, because the introduction spells out and defines the aims and scope of the thesis. The other chapters in the opening part of the thesis usually lay out the parameters and working environment, the needed theoretical basis of the thesis etc.; they can also be written fairly early on in the process. The opening part of the thesis also includes the literature review. It is highly recommended that you keep track of your references and document them while you are writing, because you might forget or lose track of your sources later.

\subsection{Write simply}

The first sentence of a paragraph should define its contents. The following sentences clarify the issue. This method results in a clear and easily understandable way of presenting, since each paragraph should contain information only on one or two separate issues. Paragraphs structured like that will be easy to cut and paste elsewhere, if structural rearrangements are later required. To avoid fragmentation, it is important to not present the same things again in different chapters. It will be easier for the reader to follow the idea when your thesis structure is logical and its linguistic style is systematic throughout the thesis. Hence, do not go “over the top” and try to impress the reader with too extravagant ways of presenting your ideas. Instead, present your case as you would like others to present their thesis.

\subsection{Ask your technical supervisor to go through what you have written}

Sometimes the principal supervisor and a technical supervisor are two separate persons, especially in the case where the thesis work is done in a company. In this case you should first have your work read by your technical supervisor. After that edit your work according to his/her advice before you bring it for revision to your principal supervisor. The technical supervisor has a better impression of your work as he/she interacts with you on a regular basis, and can therefore go through your work much faster. Your principal supervisor, however, can form a better view of your work when you bring him/her a more finished document. You should make good use of the expertise provided by your technical supervisor at all stages of your research and write-up phases. However, do not feel intimidated to show your work to your principal supervisor at the beginning of your writing phase (see \charef{relatedwork} above). It is your official supervisor who makes the final evaluation together with the second examiner. It is therefore important to listen to his/her comments at an early stage to ensure that you are not surprised or disappointed when seeing the completed evaluation form.

It is very usual to get blind to typos in one’s own text, and one also easily assumes some topics to be so self-evident that a reader has difficulties to follow the text. This is most easily found by a colleague who is not so familiar with the topic. Alternatively, you can take a break of a few days to look your text with fresh eyes---or just concentrate very carefully on what you are really saying and what you just know without writing it.

\subsection{Do not get stuck}

\figref{fig:unto_uneksija} shows how difficult the writing can be sometimes. If you feel you are not advancing with your writing, although you feel like you know your topic, there might be something wrong in the way you work. In this case, do not waste time in wondering and fretting; instead seek advice in the instructions above. If this does not help, then usually your supervisor(s) can help you in solving your problem. At the most difficult time it is good to remember that every engineer you see out there has once been in the same situation as you are now, and yet they were still able to graduate.

make you run outside and howl at the moon. --- It’s already the fourth week and I
haven’t been able to write anything else besides my name down.”}
  \label{fig:unto_uneksija}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Hints for editing}

A well-prepared document template like the current one with pre-defined paragraph formats speeds up writing. The use of automatic numbering helps to minimize manual corrections, when the order of figures, for example, is changed.

Most word processors, \LaTeX included, have a spelling checker feature that is recommended to be used. This way your supervisor does not need to spend time on spotting and correcting typos, but can concentrate on the actual contents of the thesis.

\section{Electronic version}

University of Oulu started archiving electronic versions of M.Sc. theses in January 2013. All theses will be uploaded to the Laturi system and transferred from there to the university archive once accepted. The theses will also be published in the university repository, but each student can her/himself decide the level of publicity (see \secref{sec:publicity}, “Publicity”). It should be noted that the repository provides a short link to a published thesis. Hence, the student can include the link, for example, in her/his CV, and generally use a publicly available thesis in advertising her/his skills and experience.

As part of the new archiving process, each student has to guarantee that she/he has the necessary rights and permissions to the content included in the thesis. Specifically, a student needs to ask a permissions for each figure and table not created by the student her/himself but copied from another source.

Moreover, each student can her/himself decide whether the thesis will be analyzed with a program called Urkund. This program checks the amount of similar text in the thesis and already published documents (i.e. theses delivered earlier and documents in various databases and in the Internet). The role of Urkund is twofold: First, it checks whether a student has copied text from others’ documents. Copying of few sentences is acceptable when the copied text is referenced and quoted properly; otherwise such copying is not permitted and causes official consequences---the thesis can even be rejected. Second, when the thesis is in Urkund’s databases, it checks whether others have copied text from this thesis.

We recommend allowing the thesis it be delivered to Urkund as then the thesis is protected against incorrect copying by others. However, as thesis once delivered to Urkund cannot be deleted from its databases, the text copied from others’ documents must be referenced and quoted properly in the first version delivered to Urkund. Hence, a student must \textbf{always} check correct referencing and quoting with the supervisor before delivering the work to Urkund! ITEE professors have additional tools for performing this check. The rights and permissions for thesis content can be checked at the same time.

More information can be found from the degree programme web pages \cite{mscstudies} and from Laturi’s web pages: http://laturi.oulu.fi.


\section{Optional bound versions}

It is not mandatory to bind the thesis at a printing house. However, a student is free to bind the thesis when she/he wants to have a high-quality copy for relatives, for example. For the bound thesis, the words MASTER’S THESIS should be printed in the middle of the front cover. The NAME OF THE AUTHOR of the thesis should be printed in the lower right hand corner of the front cover. The NAME OF THE AUTHOR and year of publication should be printed in the spine of the thesis. You must have your thesis bound at a printing house specialized in printing theses. The printing house will also produce and attach the cover to the printout that you have brought with you. The color of the cover has to be black. The text has to be printed on the cover, i.e., stickers should not be applied!
